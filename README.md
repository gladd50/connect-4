# About
Connect 4 is a web based game that is built using Vanilla Javascript with vite, it is made by implementing a module pattern and SOLID principle and it's also mobile responsive. __NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS STILL ONGOING, SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME FEATURES THAT CAN'T BE ACCESS YET__
# Ongoing Features
1. Playing versus computer or creating an AI to play
> I spent a week to figure out how to implement minimax algorithm but is still haven't figure it out yet  
2. Creating pop up section for the rules
# What I learned
This is my first very well planned and ambitious project so far, i learned a lot of things from this connect 4 project.

__Firstly__, I learned about how to make appealing frontend or UI by maximizing the __HTML__ and __CSS__ that oftentimes i skipped because i just want the code to run with minimal design but it's actually a bad habit because looks does matter for your app and it makes very significant difference. 
* I learned about flexbox and grid for layouting
* @media queries to make my website mobile responsive
* Creating a modal using dialog element
* Using transitions to make some animations
* Creating a toggle button
  
__Secondly__, I learned a lot about __Javascript__. I learned about how to find an available square within two dimensional array, how to make a timer for each turn, a lot of DOM manipulations and its actually that hard if you have a decent UI. Most of the times i dont really have a great interface so there are not much DOM manipulations to do but with this projects i learned how to make a great interactive website
* I learned how to design the code using module pattern with IIFE
* Create a separation between the logic controller and the screen controller
* Using Import Export ES6
  
__Lastly__, I learned about __VITE__. I used to use a webpack for organizing and bundling my JS projects, but i came across VITE and a lot of people prefer it because it is lightweight and __Blazingly Fast__. I find it hard at first because this is a new tech for me so i have to read the documentation and watch tutorials but its actually makes your projects easier and faster. I learned how organize things in VITE and also deploy static website into GitHub pages using VITE deploy
# Comment
Creating a well designed projects that take you weeks to complete is actually more preferable because you will learn a lot of things rather than creating a small projects that only have one or two features with very minimal UI. You will learn about designing your code and doing a lot of refactoring to make an efficient and readable code. It took me around 3 weeks to build this projects, but it's all worth it because i learned a lot
